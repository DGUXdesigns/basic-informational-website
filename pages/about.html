    <h2>Who Are We</h2>
    <p>
      NodeGuide was created to help developers of all levels learn and improve
      their skills in Node.js. Our mission is to provide clear, practical, and
      easy-to-follow resources so you can build powerful applications with
      confidence.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      It all started with a passion for backend development and a lack of
      structured learning resources. After struggling to find beginner-friendly
      yet practical guides, we decided to create NodeGuide. Today, we're
      dedicated to providing high-quality tutorials, tips, and tools to help
      developers master Node.js.
